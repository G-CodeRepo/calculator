# calculator
A simple calculator currently under construction and testing. Styled with CSS and logic done in vanilla Javascript (no libraries). Normally code should be separated in an MVC format for production but since this is just a simple example, all HTML, CSS, and Javascript are in a single HTML file. All buttons are working except 'mode', 'left arrow' (<), 'right arrow' (>), 'squareroot', 'exponent', and 'sign' (+/-). Internally uses postfix (reverse polish) notation to keep track of operator precedence in calculations. More functionality and improved styling will be coming soon.
